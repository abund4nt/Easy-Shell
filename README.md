Usage:

``` shell
➜  shell git:(main) ✗ python3 shell.py -h
usage: shell.py [-h] -lhost LHOST -lport LPORT

Easy Shell...

options:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit
  -lhost LHOST  Local host IP address
  -lport LPORT  Local port number
```

In my case I have an alias in the `.zshrc` to run it directly from `shell`, but who cares about that?
